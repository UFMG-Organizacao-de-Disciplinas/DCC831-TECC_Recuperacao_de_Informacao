# Docs

- 5 points for your *documentation*, assessed based on a [short (pdf) report $^6$][6] describing your implemented data structures and algorithms, their computational complexity, as well as a discussion of their empirical efficiency (e.g. the download rate throughout the crawling execution, the speedup achieved as new threads are added). Your documentation should also include a characterization of your crawled corpus, including (but not limited to) the following statistics: total number of unique domains, size distribution (in terms of number of webpages) per domain, and size distribution (in terms of number of tokens) per webpage.
